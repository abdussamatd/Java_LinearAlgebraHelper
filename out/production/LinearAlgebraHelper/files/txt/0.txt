	Addition of matrix is the basic operation performed, to add two or more matrices. Matrix addition is possible only if 
the order of the given matrices are the same. By order we mean, the number of rows and columns are the same for the matrices. 
Hence, we can add the corresponding elements of the matrices. But if the order is different then matrix addition is not 
possible. Suppose A = [aij]mxn and B = [bij]mxn are two matrices of order m x n, then the addition of A and B is given by;

	A + B = [aij]mxn + [bij]mxn = [aij + bij]mxn

	By recalling the small concept of addition of algebraic expressions, we know that while the addition of algebraic 
expressions can only be done with the corresponding like terms, similarly the addition of two matrices can be done by addition 
of corresponding terms in the matrix.

	There are basically two criteria that define the addition of a matrix. They are as follows:

	Consider two matrices A & B. These matrices can be added if (if and only if) the order of the matrices are equal, i.e. 
the two matrices have the same number of rows and columns. For example, say matrix A is of the order 3 × 4, then the matrix B 
can be added to matrix A if the order of B is also 3 × 4. The addition of matrices is not defined for matrices of different sizes. 
	Properties of Matrix Addition.
	The basic properties of matrix addition are similar to the addition of real numbers. Go through the properties given below:

	Assume that, A, B and C be three m x n matrices, The following properties hold true for the matrix addition operation. 
	Commutative Property: If A and B are two matrices of the same order, say m x n, then the addition of the two matrices is 
commutative, i.e., A + B = B + A
	Associative Property: If A, B and C are three matrices of the same order, say m x n, then the addition of the three 
matrices is associative, i.e., A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
	Additive identity: For any m x n matrix, there is an identity element. Thus, if A is m x n order matrix, then the 
additive identity of A will be zero matrix of same order, such that, A + O =  A ( where O is an additive identity)
	Additive inverse: If A is any matrix of order m x n, then the additive inverse of A will be B (= -A) of same order, 
such that, A + B = O. Hence, the sum of matrix and its additive inverse results in a zero matrix
