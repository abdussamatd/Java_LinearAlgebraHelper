	The determinant of matrix is the sum of products of the elements of any row or column and their corresponding 
co-factors. The determinant of matrix is defined only for square matrices. For any square matrix A, the determinant of 
A is denoted by det A (or) |A|. It is sometimes denoted by the symbol Δ. The process of calculating the determinants 
of 1x1 matrices and 2x2 matrices is pretty simple whereas the process becomes more complex as the order of the matrix 
increases. The process of finding the determinant of matrix involves minors and co-factors.

Here are the steps to find the determinant of matrix (a 3×3 matrix or any other matrix).

Step 1: Choose any row or column. We usually choose the first row to find the determinant.
Step 2: Find the co-factors of each of the elements of the row/column that we have chosen in Step 1.
Step 3: Multiply the elements of the row/column from Step 1 with the corresponding co-factors obtained from Step 2
Step 4: Add all the products from Step 3 which would give the determinant of the matrix.

Important Notes on Determinant of Matrix:

The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1.
The determinant of a diagonal matrix is always the product of elements of its principal diagonal.
The determinant of an orthogonal matrix is either +1 or -1.
The determinant of a matrix can be either positive, negative, or zero.
The determinant of matrix is used in Cramer's rule which is used to solve the system of equations.
Also, it is used to find the inverse of a matrix. If the determinant of a matrix is not equal to 0, then it is an 
	invertible matrix as we can find its inverse.
If A is a square matrix of order 3×3, then |kA| = k3 |A|, for any scalar k.
A square matrix A is called singular if |A| = 0 and non-singular if |A| ≠ 0.
The determinant is helpful in computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
