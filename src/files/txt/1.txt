	The subtraction of matrices or matrix subtraction can only be possible if the number of rows and columns of both the 
matrices are the same. While subtracting two matrices, we subtract the elements in each row and column from the corresponding 
elements in the row and column of the other matrix. Consider two matrices A and B of the same order 'm × n', where m is the 
number of rows and n is the number of columns of the two matrices, denoted as A = [aij] and B = [bij]. Now, the difference of 
the two matrices A and B is given as: A - B = [aij] - [bij] = [aij - bij], where ij denotes the position of each element in 
ith row and jth column. The dimension of the difference matrix, that is, A - B is also 'm × n'. All constraints for the 
addition of matrices are applied to the subtraction of matrices as well. But there are certain laws that matrix subtraction 
does not follow just like the subtraction of numbers. The most important necessity for the subtraction of matrices to hold 
all these properties is that the matrix subtraction is defined only if the order of the matrices is the same.

	The number of rows and columns should be the same for the matrix subtraction.
	The subtraction of matrices is not commutative, that is, A - B ≠ B - A
	The subtraction of matrices is not associative, that is, (A - B) - C ≠ A - (B - C)
	The subtraction of a matrix from itself results in a null matrix, that is, A - A = O.
	Subtraction of matrices is the addition of the negative of a matrix to another matrix, that is, A - B = A + (-B).
